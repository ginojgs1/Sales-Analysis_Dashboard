## Problem Statement

The business users at XYZ Traders require a centralized and accessible way to view critical business metrics. As a Power BI developer and BI expert, your objective is to create a consolidated dashboard in Microsoft Power BI Service using an already published report. This dashboard should be built within your personal workspace and structured to showcase key business insights in a clear, user-friendly format. Once created, the dashboard must be exported either as a PDF or inserted into a PowerPoint presentation to facilitate business communication and reporting.



### Task 

1.Publish the attached report (Sales report.pbix) to the Power BI Service in your personal workspace.

2.Create a new dashboard called “Sales Portfolio Dashboard-YourName”.

3.Pin Total Sales, Quantity, Total Sales by category, Total sales by country, LY Sales, CY Sales, CY & LY comparison column chart, and Top 10 customers visuals to the created dashboard in the previous step. 

4.Open your Dashboard; adda tile subtitle as “SalesPortfolio Dashboard-Developed by your name”.

5.Use the Q&A feature to find out the top 5countriesby  Sales and use Donut Chart to visualize it; pinthis visual also on the same dashboard.

6.Open Dashboard full-screenmode and use the print button to export/save your dashboard into the pdf/power point option. You can take screenshotsof this dashboard and save them into a PowerPointfile
